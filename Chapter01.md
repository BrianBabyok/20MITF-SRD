# Chapter 1: Introduction

In 20 Minutes Into The Future, you play as a team of highly skilled operatives who specialize in handling missions that are beyond the capabilities of traditional law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Your missions will take you to the darkest corners of society, where you will face dangerous criminals, international terrorists, and other threats that require your unique skills and expertise. 

In this game, reality is your plaything. With your reality warping ability, you can change reality itself and bend it to your will. Want to distract a guard by making them forget what they were doing? Want to create a diversion by causing a massive traffic jam? Want to create an escape route by hacking a secret passage into existence? If you can think it, you can make it happen. But be warned: warping reality is a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and the consequences of failure can be severe. 

Your team has access to advanced technology, powerful weapons, and a range of specialized skills that will help you complete your missions. But your success will also depend on your ability to work together, think on your feet, and improvise in the face of unexpected challenges. In 20 Minutes Into The Future, you are the heroes of a world that needs you more than ever.
